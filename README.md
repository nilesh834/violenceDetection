# Violence Detection
Video Frame Classification for Violence Detection
– Tools & technologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Colab
– Developed a machine learning model to classify video frames as violent or non-violent using a deep learning approach. Achieved high accuracy by training a custom model with MobileNet as the base, incorporating data augmentation, and employing both frame-by-frame and key-frame extraction methods. Successfully processed and
categorized video frames, enhancing the detection of violence in real-time video feeds.
